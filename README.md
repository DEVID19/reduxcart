# 🛒 ReduxCart – A Learning Project

ReduxCart is a fully functional e-commerce cart application I built **from scratch** as part of my journey to **master Redux Toolkit**. This project helped me understand core Redux concepts like slice creation, actions, reducers, local state syncing with `localStorage`, and how to manage a global cart state efficiently.

---

## 📚 Why I Built This

I built this project to get real-world experience with:

- 🔄 Redux Toolkit (`createSlice`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`)
- 🛠️ Global state management for a shopping cart
- 🔍 Implementing search/filter features
- 💾 Using `localStorage` to persist cart data
- 🎨 Building responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS
- 🧠 Understanding the data flow in modern React + Redux apps

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Browse 100+ products fetched from [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/products)
- 🔍 Search products by title or description
- 🛒 Add / Remove items from cart
- ➕➖ Increment and Decrement item quantity
- 🧮 Auto-calculated total quantity & price
- 💾 Cart state is saved in `localStorage` so it's preserved on refresh
- 📱 Fully responsive design for all screen sizes

## 🔧 Tech Stack
