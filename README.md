# üõí ReduxCart ‚Äì A Learning Project

ReduxCart is a fully functional e-commerce cart application I built **from scratch** as part of my journey to **master Redux Toolkit**. This project helped me understand core Redux concepts like slice creation, actions, reducers, local state syncing with `localStorage`, and how to manage a global cart state efficiently.

- üîç Implementing search/filter features
- üíæ Using `localStorage` to persist cart data
- üé® Building responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS
- üß† Understanding the data flow in modern React + Redux apps
